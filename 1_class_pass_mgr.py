""" Write a class called Password_manager. 
The class should have a list called old_passwords that holds all of the user's past passwords. 
The last item of the list is the user's current pass word.
There should be a method called get_password that returns the current password and a method called set_password that sets the user's password. 
The set_password method should only change the password if the attempted password is different from all the user's past passwords.
Finally, create a method called is_correct that receives a string and returns a boolean True or False 
depending on whether the string is equal to the current password or not. """
